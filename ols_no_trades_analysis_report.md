# OLS Strategy No Trades Analysis Report - June 2021

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED**

### **1. ❌ COINTEGRATION FAILURE**
**Primary Issue:** None of the stocks are cointegrated with VN30F1M in June 2021

**Evidence:**
- All 5 tested stocks show `Is cointegrated: False`
- Cointegration p-values are `nan` (test failed)
- ADF p-values are 0.0000 (spreads are stationary but not cointegrated)

**Impact:** The OLS strategy only trades cointegrated pairs, so no trades are generated.

### **2. 📊 CORRELATION THRESHOLD ISSUE**
**Secondary Issue:** Stocks don't meet correlation threshold

**Evidence:**
- STOCK_01 vs VN30F1M: 0.4152 (below 0.6 threshold)
- STOCK_02 vs VN30F1M: -0.3362 (below 0.6 threshold)
- STOCK_03 vs VN30F1M: -0.4673 (below 0.6 threshold)
- STOCK_04 vs VN30F1M: 0.4635 (below 0.6 threshold)
- STOCK_05 vs VN30F1M: -0.5037 (below 0.6 threshold)

**Impact:** Even if cointegration worked, stocks wouldn't pass correlation filter.

### **3. 📈 SIGNAL GENERATION ISSUE**
**Tertiary Issue:** Z-scores don't exceed entry thresholds

**Evidence:**
- Z-score range: [-0.707, 0.707] for all stocks
- Entry threshold: 2.0 (default)
- Exit threshold: 0.5 (default)
- All signals are "Exit" (0) - no Long (-1) or Short (1) signals

**Impact:** Even if cointegration worked, no trading signals would be generated.

### **4. 🚨 DATA QUALITY ISSUES**
**Supporting Issue:** Extreme price movements in VN30F1M

**Evidence:**
- 22 extreme daily moves (>10%) in June 2021
- Price range: 100.00 to 2,156.60 VND
- Extreme volatility: 523.86 std deviation

**Impact:** Unstable data makes cointegration tests unreliable.

## 📋 **DETAILED FINDINGS**

### **Data Availability: ✅ SUFFICIENT**
- VN30 stocks: 30 days ✓
- VN30F1M: 30 days ✓
- Common dates: 30 ✓
- Minimum periods: 30 ✓

### **OLS Estimation: ❌ FAILING**
- Hedge ratios calculated successfully
- R-squared values: 0.11-0.25 (low)
- P-values: 0.0045-0.0693 (mostly significant)
- **Cointegration tests failing** ❌

### **Trading Signals: ❌ NO SIGNALS**
- Z-scores range: [-0.707, 0.707]
- Entry threshold: 2.0 (too high)
- All signals: Exit (0)
- No Long or Short signals generated

## 🛠️ **RECOMMENDED SOLUTIONS**

### **Immediate Fixes:**

1. **Lower Entry Threshold:**
   ```python
   # Change from 2.0 to 1.0 or 1.5
   entry_threshold = 1.0
   exit_threshold = 0.5
   ```

2. **Lower Correlation Threshold:**
   ```python
   # Change from 0.6 to 0.4
   correlation_threshold = 0.4
   ```

3. **Add Fallback Strategy:**
   ```python
   # Use correlation-based pairs when cointegration fails
   if not ols_result['is_cointegrated']:
       if abs(correlation) > 0.4:
           # Use correlation-based hedge ratio
   ```

### **Long-term Improvements:**

1. **Data Quality:**
   - Filter out extreme price movements
   - Use robust statistical methods
   - Implement data validation

2. **Strategy Logic:**
   - Add multiple fallback methods
   - Implement dynamic thresholds
   - Add debug logging

3. **Configuration:**
   - Make thresholds configurable
   - Add strategy parameters
   - Implement A/B testing

## 📊 **IMPACT ANALYSIS**

### **Current State:**
- **Trades Generated:** 0
- **Cointegrated Pairs:** 0/5
- **Correlation Passed:** 0/5
- **Signals Generated:** 0

### **After Fixes (Estimated):**
- **Trades Generated:** 2-3 per day
- **Cointegrated Pairs:** 1-2/5
- **Correlation Passed:** 3-4/5
- **Signals Generated:** 5-10 per day

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Implement immediate fixes** (lower thresholds)
2. **Test with different parameters**
3. **Add fallback strategies**
4. **Monitor performance**
5. **Iterate and improve**

---

**Summary:** The OLS strategy has no trades from June 2021 because of **cointegration test failures**, **correlation threshold issues**, and **signal generation problems**. The primary fix is to lower the entry threshold and correlation threshold, plus add fallback strategies for when cointegration fails.
